# ArithmeticSkills
I originally created this for an "Algorithms Challenge" set by my teacher in my Computer Science class but I never finished it in class and then I was like "I really want this to work" so I made it work and now it works and here is the code.

The original challenge was "Challenge 39: A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students. The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in each case any two numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask studentâ€™s name, then ask 10 questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final score out of 10. Scores from the quiz should be stored and added to when a student takes a new quiz. Write an algorithm for the process described above.

So I did it.

It's probably not the best way to do it but it's "the quick bodge it together approach" as Tom Scott would say.

You can see the code [here](https://github.com/bigmancallum/ArithmeticSkills/blob/main/main.py). You can see an example of the results.txt text file where your results will be stored [here](https://github.com/bigmancallum/ArithmeticSkills/blob/main/results.txt).
